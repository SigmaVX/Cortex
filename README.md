# Cortex - Test the limits of your memory with React JS.
Cortex is a simple way to test your memory.  Click an image to score a point but avoid clicking any image twice.  This React JS app randomly shuffles all the images after each selection using class component states that are passed between parent and child components. The app also integrates Bootstrap 4, CSS Animations, and React Sticky.
